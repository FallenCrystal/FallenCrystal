## :wave:

Maybe I should say hello literally. But I'm writing this page to remove `github-metrics.svg` from my `README.md`...

## Languages / Skills

<details>
    <summary><del>Literal language?</del></summary>
    <p>My native language is Chinese. I also know a little bit of English. 
    But that's basically to help me use the translator better. 
    You can speak English to me anyway. I can also reply to you in English.</p>
</details>

The main programming languages I use are Java and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

I use Kotlin to develop some simple applications or mix them with Java to reduce the time I waste on some code.

I'm learning to make Minecraft mods through use Fabric/Forge. I'll also take the time to learn about bytecode in Java.

Skills mastered so far:

- Minecraft:
    - Protocol. Except for how the packets are encoded. I'm also aware of some cheats or exploits.
      ([R.I.P. wiki.vg](https://tkte.ch/articles/2024/11/11/sunsetting.html))
    - [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) (including CraftBukkit)
    - [Sponge Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) (mods develop)
    - [Fabric Access Wideners](https://wiki.fabricmc.net/tutorial:accesswideners) (mods develop)
- [Netty](https://netty.io/) (It is also used in Minecraft protocol. But I'll do something else with it as well)
- [Bytebuddy](https://bytebuddy.net/)
- Discord Bot ([JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA))
- There are a few other bits and pieces...

I know a little bit about JavaScript, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).
But I usually use these skills to modify other applications.
I don't use these languages myself.

Although I would use those programming languages. But I've never used [Spring](https://spring.io/)
or developed [Android apps](https://developer.android.com/).

## Games to play

I play Minecraft almost exclusively. Unless playing with friends. Otherwise, I wouldn't have played any other games.

In the beginning, I only played vanilla. (smp or other servers that don't require additional mods to play).
After I got bored with the smp, I switched to playing mod-packs.

I would always add [Farmer's Delight](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight) to Minecraft.
If I'm not playing vanilla and the version I'm playing supports it.

## Projects

- [BlockerVelocity](https://github.com/CatMoe/BlockerVelocity) - 
  Quick and easy command and command suggestion interceptor made for the Velocity proxy. Support MiniMessage.
- [Journey](https://github.com/CatMoe/Journey) -
  My own bukkit plugin lib. Focus on null-safety and scalability. But I don't currently write any bukkit plugins. So its maintenance has been paused.
- [NBTGenerator](https://github.com/FallenCrystal/NBTGenerator) -
  Does your applications for Minecraft require a registry? 
  Stop interrupting your applications because of registry updates. 
  Use the latest registry in minutes and reduce the size of the registry as much as possible.
- NotEnoughDelight (Public soon) -
  A Minecraft mod-pack. Guide and enhance your cooking experience in Minecraft. And try to fix the fatal problems caused by any mod.
- Lavender (Planning) -
  Another reverse proxy for Minecraft. 
  Add support for additional proxy software while maintaining performance. 
  Alternatives to e4mc.

### Do you know?

- If you don't know how to come up with a good name for your project. I'll tell you about a flower that I like. Seriously. 
I don't like the words "Ultimate" or "Epic" to appear in the name of a project.
- I write code to pass the time when I don't want to play for a while.
- I drink black coffee just one way to like it. I never go to coffee just to stay awake.
